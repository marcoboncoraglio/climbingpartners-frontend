# Climbing partners
Application to find climbing partners around you

# TODO

### icons
- icon for brand

### Implement backend
- Get request for all users within a certain range
- Eventually reimplement entire backend with node, express and mongoose

### Messages
- personal messages
- add groups and group chat

### Users
- add img for usr and crop somehow?
- implement settings backend (without checking for radius yet)

### Friends
- improve friends logic, add pending state

### Settings
- implement privacy store that handles visibility
- Add privacy field in locations database
    - to handle whether a user can be seen

### Find Partners View
- view that shows icons of climbers in your area as listview
    - like friendsview, just for climbers around you

### Map
- change functionality to be more of a visualization tool
    - create circles around areas with many climbers with caption x number of climbers in this circle
    - allow the display of posts

### Posts
- allow users to create posts on the map (visibility in settings) that represent climbing trips where people can join

### Unit tests
- write unit tests :)

### Bugs
- Limit zooming out in map
- friends "Keys should be unique"
- refactor really ugly AppViewProfileCard code :(
- Someone has added you! does not show up in FriendsView 
- Update and migrate dependencies
- FriendsView, no element under "Your Friends", element over is. Navite to element over it and go back. Element under "Your Friend" appears
